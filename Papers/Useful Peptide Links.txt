MLACP 2.0
The MLACP 2.0 model uses multiple feature encodings and classifiers, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to accurately predict ACPs from their sequence information. 
Methodology:
Creates a meta-model by combining 11 different feature encodings and eight different classifiers.
Uses a CNN to combine the outputs of the best-performing models to produce the final prediction.

ML-PDGA
The ML-PDGA repository uses a generative recurrent neural network (RNN) and a genetic algorithm to design novel anticancer and antimicrobial peptides. 
Methodology:
Fine-tunes a generative RNN on existing ACPs and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).
Utilizes a genetic algorithm to further optimize the generated peptides for desired properties.

ACL: ACLPred
The ACLPred model uses an interpretable tree-based ML method to screen for potential ACPs. It uses SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to explain which molecular features contribute most to the model's decisions. 
Methodology:
Employs tree-based ML models trained on topological features of peptide sequences.
Integrates SHAP analysis for model interpretability.

ACP-MCAM
The ACP-MCAM model employs a multi-kernel CNN with an attention mechanism to identify ACPs. It can automatically learn features from sequence information and interpret how different parts of a peptide sequence influence its anticancer activity. 
Methodology:
Uses a multi-kernel CNN to learn both local and global sequence features.
Incorporates an attention mechanism to weigh the importance of different amino acids.
